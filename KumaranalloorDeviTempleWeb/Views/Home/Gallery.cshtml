                                    The most important day of kumaranalloor devi is karthika star of malayalam month vrischika (devi's birthday).

                                    Once, on a karthika day of vrischika the noble vilvamangalam swamiyar came to thrissur vadakkunnatha temple. When he reached there he understood with his divine eyes that there was not the presence of vadakkunathan(lord shiva) in the sreekovil. He came out to circumambulate the temple. When he reached near the south wall, he visions the presence of lord shiva there. He asked lord why came to the wall. ‘i am seeing kumaranalloor devi coming after arattu'(holy bath). Even today, the madhyana pooja (mid day pooja) in vadakkunnatha temple is at the south wall of the temple on the day of karthika during the month of vrischika.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The concept is that on the karthika day of vrischika, all the deities came to see the return of devi after the arattu. Witnessing this event is said to be excellent for long life.
